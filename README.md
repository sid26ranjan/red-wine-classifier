# red-wine-classifier

In this notebook, First I have done some exploration on the data using matplotlib and seaborn. Then, I use different classifier models to predict the quality of the wine.

1. Logistic regression

2. Random Forest Classifier

3. Support Vector Classifier(SVC)

then i did some resampling in the given data as the data is imbalanced which gave me some different results.

it is a Simple and clean practice dataset for regression or classification modelling.we have to classify the category of the wine based on the given
parameters.

for the complete details about the problem statement visit https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009.
the dataset is also available there.
